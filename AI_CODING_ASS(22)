#Lab 22 – Advanced Ethical Considerations: Addressing Complex Scenarios and Limitations


"""Task 1 – Bias Detection in AI Suggestions (Alternative Example)
Example Scenario:
Ask AI to generate a resume shortlisting algorithm multiple times.
• Change prompt wording (e.g., “select best candidate” vs “ensure
diversity”).
• Compare outputs and logic.
Discussion Points:
• Does the AI favor certain qualifications, backgrounds, or
experiences?
• How could biased shortlisting algorithms affect equal
employment opportunities?"""

Great scenario to explore bias in AI! Let’s break it down step by step:

---

## 🧪 Experiment Setup
You ask an AI to generate a **resume shortlisting algorithm** multiple times, but you change the wording of the prompt:
- **Prompt A:** “Select the best candidate.”
- **Prompt B:** “Ensure diversity in candidate selection.”

---

## ⚙️ Likely Outputs & Logic
- **Prompt A (Best Candidate):**
  - The algorithm may prioritize traditional metrics like years of experience, prestigious universities, or specific technical skills.
  - It could lean toward candidates from backgrounds historically overrepresented in certain industries (e.g., elite schools, majority demographics).

- **Prompt B (Ensure Diversity):**
  - The algorithm may introduce balancing mechanisms, such as weighting underrepresented groups more favorably.
  - It might highlight varied educational paths, non-traditional experiences, or broader skill sets.

---

## 🔍 Bias Detection
- **Favoring Certain Qualifications:** If the AI consistently selects candidates with Ivy League degrees or long corporate experience, it reflects bias toward privileged backgrounds.
- **Overcorrection Risk:** If diversity prompts lead to overlooking qualifications entirely, the algorithm could swing too far, introducing reverse bias.
- **Hidden Biases:** Even when asked to “ensure diversity,” the AI might still rely on biased training data (e.g., resumes from historically dominant groups).

---

## ⚖️ Impact on Equal Employment
- **Reduced Opportunities:** Biased shortlisting could systematically exclude qualified candidates from marginalized groups.
- **Reinforcement of Inequality:** If algorithms favor certain schools or companies, they perpetuate existing social and economic divides.
- **Trust & Fairness:** Candidates may lose trust in hiring systems if they suspect bias, undermining equal opportunity principles.

---

## 💡 Discussion Points
- How should organizations **audit AI hiring tools** to detect hidden bias?
- Should algorithms be designed to **balance merit and diversity**, or should diversity be handled outside the algorithm (e.g., human oversight)?
- What safeguards (like transparency reports or fairness metrics) could ensure **equal employment opportunities**?

---

Would you like me to **simulate sample pseudocode outputs** for both prompts (Best Candidate vs Ensure Diversity) so you can see how the logic might differ in practice







"""Task 2 – Privacy and Sensitive Data Handling (Alternative
Example)
Example Scenario:
Ask AI to write code for processing student academic records (roll
number, marks, email).
Discussion Points:
• How should student identity data be masked or encrypted?
• What privacy laws (e.g., FERPA, GDPR-like principles) are
relevant?
• What ethical responsibility does the programmer have when
using AI-generated code?"""
